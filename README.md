# Documentation for React Portfolio with Email Functionality

This documentation provides the necessary steps to create a portfolio using React and add email functionality. The portfolio will serve as a platform to showcase your work and allow visitors to contact you through a contact form.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create React Project**: Open the terminal and run the following command to create a new React project:

**npx create-react-app portfolio**


2. **Project Setup**: Access the created project directory:

**cd portfolio**


3. **Install Libraries**: Install the necessary libraries for email functionality. Some popular options include `nodemailer` for sending emails and `react-hook-form` for handling the contact form. Run the following commands:

npm install nodemailer
npm install react-hook-form


4. **Design and Structure the Portfolio**: Design and create the structure of your portfolio using React components. Organize your files and folders appropriately for better code readability and maintenance.

5. **Implement Contact Form**: Create a contact form component using `react-hook-form`. Define the required fields such as name, email address, and message. Refer to the official `react-hook-form` documentation for more details on its implementation.

6. **Configure Nodemailer**: Create a `mailer.js` file in the utilities folder of your project. In this file, configure `nodemailer` with the details of your outgoing mail server (SMTP) and the required credentials. Refer to the official `nodemailer` documentation for more information on configuration.

7. **Implement Email Sending**: In the contact form component, import the `mailer.js` file and use the email sending function provided by `nodemailer` to send the email with the details entered by the visitor.

8. **Styling the Portfolio**: Use CSS or a styling library like `styled-components` to style and customize your portfolio according to your preferences and needs.

9. **Testing and Adjustments**: Perform thorough testing of the portfolio and contact form. Verify that emails are sent successfully and that the form functionality works as expected. Make adjustments and improvements to the design and functionality if necessary.

10. **Deploying the Portfolio**: Use a web hosting platform or hosting services like Netlify or Vercel to deploy your portfolio and make it accessible online.
